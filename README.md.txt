Find Me/EcoWise is an eco-conscious affiliate storefront dedicated to curating sustainable, ethically sourced, and environmentally friendly products from trusted partners. Our mission is to make green living accessible and appealing by promoting responsible consumption across categories such as zero-waste essentials, natural personal care, ethical fashion, sustainable home goods, and plastic-free packaging. Every product featured links to an affiliate partner, allowing us to earn a small commission—at no additional cost to the shopper—which supports the maintenance and growth of our platform while backing eco-friendly brands. Built with a modern, lightweight tech stack (such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or React) and optionally supported by a CMS or backend, EcoWise is easy to run and customize. Products are added by inserting affiliate links along with product details like name, eco-attributes, price, and imagery. We welcome contributions from developers and conscious consumers alike who want to expand our collection or improve the storefront experience.
